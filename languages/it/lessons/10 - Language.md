If someone on the street asks you a question, you can just reply with:

:word{en="excuse me, I don't speak Italian" }
:word{en="I don't know, sorry" }

If you want to strike up more of a conversation...

:word{en="do you speak English?" }
:word{en="I speak English" }
:word{en="do you speak Italian?" }
:word{en="I speak a little Italian" }
:word{en="please speak to me in Italian" }

:word{en="do you understand?" }
:word{en="I understand" }
:word{en="I understand a little bit" }
:word{en="I don't understand" }

:word{en="please speak more slowly" }
:word{en="please say that again" }
:word{en="please write it down" }
:word{en="how do you say [phrase] in Italian?" }
:word{en='in English we say "[phrase]"' }
