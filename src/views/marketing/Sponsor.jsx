    <h1>Support free language education</h1>

    <p>
      This website is free to use and open source, meaning anyone can run a full copy on their own servers at no cost. You can also browse all of our lessons (and submit suggestions!) on our Github page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like every website, we still need money to keep the servers running. If you have the means, please consider supporting this project with a donation.
