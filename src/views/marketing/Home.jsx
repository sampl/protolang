    title: "What's wrong with apps like Duolingo?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        Lots of language apps make it easy to start learning by giving you a very narrow, prescriptive learning path. But this narrow path soon makes it difficult to make progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protolang takes the opposite approach: we open the floodgates and give immediate access to everything you need to learn. Instead of spoon-feeding you, our goal is to give you a rich language playground for you to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some other differences between Protolang and Duolingo specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Duolingo rewards with users with fake prizes like digital coins, "gold", and status, while Protolang is focused on rewarding you with fluency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Duolingo is a large for-profit company backed by venture capitalists with proprietary, closed-source course content. Protolang is an open-source project with <Link to="/open-source">free, open-licensed content</Link> everyone can use and share for free.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  },
  {
    title: "Is it really free?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        This website is free to use at no cost to anyone in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may create a premium set of paid features in the future to help support the site, but the core experience will stay free. All contributions from our contributors will always be free under our <a href="/open-source">open licenses</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improving and maintaining this site costs money and time. If you believe in our mission and you have the means to give, please <a href="/sponsor">consider becoming a sponsor</a>.
      </p>
    </>
  },
  {
    title: "What exactly do you mean by \"open source\"?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        Unlike Duolingo (and every other major learning app), all the source code of this website is freely available under a permissive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source license</a>. That means you can copy the code, run it on for free your own computer, and contribute your own features back to the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content of our lessons is also open source, which means you can download, print, and share these lessons for free (as long as you don't sell them for commercial profit). In theory, you could learn a language just by reading our lesson text and never use the website at all.
      </p>
      <p>

  {
    title: "Can I help?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes! We are actively looking for multi-lingual volunteers, people with language teaching experience, and software developers to help build this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of your contributions are released under the same <a href="/open-source">open licenses</a>, which means they will be made indefinitely available for free to everyone in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read our <a href="/contributing">contributor guidelines</a> to learn how to get started.

  },
  {
    title: "Will you add my favorite language?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        Because we are an open-source app, we need expertise from volunteers to add more languages.
      </p>

    title: "Why does the website look old?",
    content: <>
      <p>
        While Protolang is in active early development, we're focusing on making it useful before we make it pretty. Stay tuned for style updates.

    title: "Who made this?",
