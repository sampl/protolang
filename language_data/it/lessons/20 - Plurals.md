How do you refer to more than one of something?

In English, you often add an "s". For example, "one apple" vs "many apple*s*".

In Italian, you change the vowel at end of the word, depending on if the word is masculine or feminine.

One apple is:

:word{en="apple" it="mela"}

But two apple*s* is:

:word{en="apple" it="mele"}

The feminine **-a** becomes **-e**

Let's do another example...

One boy is:

:word{en="boy" it="ragazzo"}

But two boy*s* is:

:word{en="boy" it="ragazzi"}

The masculine **-o** becomes **-i**

|           | singular | plural |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| masculine | -o       | -i     |
| feminine  | -a       | -e     |

There are a few exceptions though!
