Welcome to Italian!

The word for "hello" in Italian is "ciao" (sounds like "chow").

Click below to hear it and repeat the phase out loud.

:word{en="hello" }

--------------------------------------------------

Have you ever heard that "Aloha" means both hello and goodbye in Hawaii? Well in Italian, ciao is both hello and goodbye too:

:word{en="goodbye" }

--------------------------------------------------

:word{en="no" }
:word{en="yes" }

--------------------------------------------------

If you're asking for something, you'll want please and thank you.

:word{en="please" }
:word{en="thank you" }
:word{en="you're welcome" }

--------------------------------------------------

If you're in someone's way on the street (or in line at the Colosseum) you might want these...

:word{en="excuse me" }
:word{en="sorry" }

--------------------------------------------------

But it's not all bad... if you want to say something is awesome, try this:

:word{en="great!" }
