# Language files

These folders contain JSON describing/associating words and lessons for all language courses.

## Types of files

The **full language dictionaries** are generated from the English-language [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) and parsed by [Wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract). Parsed JSON language files are quite large, so they are not included in version control as of yet. However they can be downloaded directly (already parsed) at [https://kaikki.org/dictionary/].

**Lesson files** are included in this folder, as are **word files** that include useful data about words that may not appear in the full language dictionaries.

## Things to add

- A & the
- If's, and's, & but's (conditionals)

- The arts: art, science, theater, literature, painting
