# Contribute to Protolang open-source

Welcome! We're so glad you're here :)

We're currently looking for help in the following areas...

## Building language courses

Are you proficient in a language besides English? Help us build a new course!

We need people to help with:

- Finishing and improving the existing Italian course
- Creating new courses in other languages
- Resolving user-reported errors in our translation

Currently our lessons are written in a customized Markdown format. You can browse the [Italian lessons here](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/tree/main/languages/it/lessons) (coming soon) and submit your own using the Github pull request system. We know this is an extremely poor process for non-technIcal contributors and [we want your feedback](/contact) on how we can create a better process.

## Software development

Our app is a React-based, front-end-heavy app with a Supabase/Postgres backend. The [developer documentation](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/blob/main/docs) has details on how to set up your own local development and testing environment.

We need help with:

- Fixing bugs
- Building new features
- Ideally migrating to Next.js, Typescript, and Prisma
- Making the app more responsive and work on more platforms
- Working with open-source, ML-based translation and chatbot tools

How to get started:

- If you have an idea for a new feature, [start a discussion](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/discussions) (coming soon)
- Take a look at the [Github issues list](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/issues) (coming soon) for good first issues
- Or [contact us](https://protolang.com/contact/) directly

## Other help

- **Language practice partners** (coming soon) - No matter what language you speak, you can make yourself available to Protolang users who want to practice. Sometimes they will be trying to learn your language and you can split your time equally; others may give their time generously.
- **Community moderators** (coming soon) - If youâ€™ve been active with us for a few months, consider applying to be one of our community moderators
- **Surprise us!** - Is there something else you think you can add to the project? [Get in touch](https://protolang.com/contact/) and let us know!
