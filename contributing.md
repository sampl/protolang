# Contribute to Protolang open-source

Welcome! We're so glad you're here :)

We're currently looking for help in the following areas...

## Writing language courses - HELP WANTED

Are you proficient in a language besides English? Help us build a new course!

We need people to help with:

- Finishing and improving the existing Italian course
- Creating new courses in other languages
- Resolving user-reported errors in our translation

Protolang is a wiki, so you can edit your language course directly in Protolang. **[Contact us](https://protolang.com/contact) to request edit access first** (only because we don't have good spam blocking yet). Currently our lessons are written in a customized [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format.

## Software development

Our app is a React-based, front-end-heavy app with a Supabase/Postgres backend.

We need help with:

- Building new features
- Fixing bugs
- Migrating to Typescript
- Making the app more responsive and work on more platforms
- Working with open-source, ML-based translation and chatbot tools

How to get started:

- Read the [developer documentation](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/blob/main/docs)
- If you have an idea for a new feature, [start a discussion](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/discussions) (coming soon)
- Take a look at the [Github issues list](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/issues) (coming soon) for good first issues
- Or [contact us](https://protolang.com/contact/) directly

## Other help

- **Language practice partners** (coming soon) - No matter what language you speak, you can make yourself available to Protolang users who want to practice. Sometimes they will be trying to learn your language and you can split your time equally; others may give their time generously.
- **Surprise us!** - Is there something else you think you can add to the project? [Get in touch](https://protolang.com/contact/) and let us know!
