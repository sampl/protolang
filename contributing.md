# Contributing to the Protolang project

If you're reading this, that means you're curious about helping with the Protolang project. WELCOME! We're so glad you're here :)

## How to contribute

We're currently looking for contributors in the following areas:

### Language courses

Are you proficient in a language besides English? Help us build a new course!

We need people to help with:

- Finishing and improving the existing Italian course
- Creating new courses in other languages
<!-- - Resolving user-reported errors in our translation -->

How to get started:

- Write your lessons or course and submit a pull request
- See our [list of most requested courses](TODO)

### Software development

Our app is a Next.js/React-based, front-end-heavy app with a Supabase/Postgres backend. The [readme](readme.md) has details on how to set up your own local development and testing environment.

We need help with:

- Fixing bugs
- Building new features
- Working with open-source translation and chatbot tools

How to get started:

- Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sampl/protolang/issues) (especially the "help wanted" and "good first PR" tags)
- If you have an idea for a new feature, [start a discussion](TODO) or [contact us](https://protolang.com/contact/) directly first to make sure it has a good chance of being merged

### Other help

- **Language practice partners** - No matter what language you speak, you can make yourself available to Protolang users who want to practice. Sometimes they will be trying to learn your language and you can split your time equally; others may give their time generously.
- **Community moderators** - If youâ€™ve been active with us for a few months, consider applying to be one of our community moderators
- **Surprise us!** - Is there something else you think you can add to the project? [Get in touch](https://protolang.com/contact/) and let us know!
